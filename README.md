# Vehicle-Builder-Challenge üèçÔ∏è

## Description

This is a command-line application that allows users to create and manage different types of vehicles: **Cars**, **Trucks**, **Motorbikes**. Users can interact with the application to input vehicle's details, color, make, model, year, and other vehicles-specific attributes.


The project was a great learning experience and it demonstrates how **OOP**( Object Oriented Programming) works.

## Installation

Simply go to **Terminal** and to start the command-line application you need to run with "``npm start``". This will begin the application and first give you the option to "Create a new vehicle"or "Select an existing vehicle". once selected you will build your vehicle. üöó

#### The video should demonstrate:
